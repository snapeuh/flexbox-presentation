# Flexbox

## Presentation

The presentation is available on Google Slides (read-only) : https://goo.gl/oD7xzY. It features comments so you know which examples are used in a slide.

## Examples

The examples are live on GitHub Pages : http://snapeuh.github.io/flexbox-presentation/.

Also, you can clone this repository and serve it. I use [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server) to do that.

Here's a list of available keyboard shortcuts :

* Left arrow : Previous example
* Right arrow : Next example
* R : Refresh current example (in case you want to hot refresh an example you edit for your viewers)

Please keep in mind that sometimes you have to resize your browser window to prove some effects (<code>flex-wrap</code> for example)

The examples support is tailor-made for the presentation using Zepto and Flexbox.
