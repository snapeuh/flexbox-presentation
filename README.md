# Flexbox

## Presentation

The presentation is available on Google Slides (read-only) : https://goo.gl/oD7xzY. It features comments so you know which examples are used in a slide.

##Â Examples

The examples are live on GitHub Pages : http://snapeuh.github.io/flexbox-presentation/.

Also, you can clone this repository and serve it. I use [johnpapa/lite-server](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server) to do that.

Here's a list of available keyboard shortcuts :

* Left arrow : Previous example
* Right arrow : Next example
* R : Refresh current example (in case you want to hot refresh an example you edit for your viewers)

The examples support is tailor-made for the presentation using Zepto and Flexbox.
